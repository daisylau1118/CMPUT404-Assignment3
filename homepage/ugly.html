                <h1>Technical History</h1>
                <p>Outside of class projects, I have participated in the Technovation program for women in 2019 where I worked in a team of four to produce an app and practice a pitch as if we were to sell our idea to companies. The app was developped through Android Studio and Firebase. We won seocnd place out of about 8 teams.</p>
